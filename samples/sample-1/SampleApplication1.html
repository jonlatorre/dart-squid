<!--
The outermost SVG element defines our SVG Canvas with a default coordinate system established 1:1 with pixels;
i.e., a unit of "1" = "1px" at this point in time.
An initial viewport coordinate system and an initial user coordinate system exist such that the two coordinates systems are identical.

The origin in this coordinate system places 0,0 at the upper-left corner, and all content is rendered to the right and down from there.
The relation between a viewBox and the

   width="100%"
   height="100%"
   width="1200"
   height="900"
   viewBox="0 0 848.5 636.4"

NOTE: THE WIDTH/HEIGHT SPECIFIED HERE (VERY LARGE; set to a value guaranteed larger than max browser-window-size)
ARE DUE TO THE FACT THAT "100%" SPECIFICATION IS NOT RE-ADJUSTING DOWN-THROUGH SVG TREE DURING OUR CANVAS.ReSize() EVENT and subsequent painting of widgets.
This was affecting the repaint of any widgets that were aligned to Right and/or Bottom of Canvas
and then Moved (with mouse)... then, if canvas was resized by reducing width/height of Browser's window, the new canvas bounds (smaller) would chop off parts of
embedded child widgets (contained in their own SVG) in the formerly aligned-to-canvas-bounds parent widgets.
TODO: there must be another way to resolve this without making the canvas huge.
