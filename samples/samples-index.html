<h1>Dart / SVG dart-squid Samples Index</h1>

<div><p>Note: these samples appear here only in their native DART version and will require the
    <a href="http://gsdview.appspot.com/dartium-archive/continuous/" target="_blank">Dartium browser for your platform.</a>
    Dartium browser is also included with the <a href="http://gsdview.appspot.com/dart-editor-archive-integration/latest/" target="_blank">Dart Editor</a>.</p></div>

<h2>dart-squid Sample #1</h2>
<h3><a href="./sample-1/sample_1.html">Sample #1 (SVG wrapped in HTML)</a></h3>
<p>This is a very basic visual demonstration of the <strong>dart-squid Widgets</strong> in action.
Play around a bit and you will notice some alignment features (between widgets and related to browser-window boundaries),
some position-constraint features that invoke during movement,
the ability to hide/show Widgets (including any hierarchically contained), multi-select, re-size/movement, and so forth.</p>

<p>
<b>Note:</b> Until reported
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/dart/issues/detail?id=2977" target="_blank">Dart Issue 2977 (ElementImplementation behavior fluctuates based on containing doc type (HTML vs. SVG)</a>
is resolved, this example will not fully work (it may even "aw-snap" the first time; refresh browser and it should partially
work (showing widgets will move/size, sorta) and allow you to see where innerHTML issue is hit that crashes things.
The same Dart code, run from both a standalone SVG document and from within an HTML document, will not work in the SVG
document due to weird object-hierarchy issues or something that makes "innerHTML" unknown. Notice that the HTML version
of this example (above) is just a wrapper around the identical SVG structure.
</p>
<p>Another issue with the non-wrapped SVG version is odd behavior with event-code removal, thus making the
selection (and de-selection) of widgets unpredictable or impossible.  Again, this may be very much related to issue
2977 (with regards to the element hierarchy in DART) since, by simply wrapping this SVG doc with a dummy-HTML file,
the behavior within the embedded SVG is totally as expected and predictable.  Clearly something is screwy in the Dart
HTML library with regards to SVG elements that are "standalone" vs. "wrapped".</p>
<p>
    The ultimate goal was to remove the need for an outer HTML "wrapper" and have the entire "application" be
    just an SVG document with all sorts of embedded functionality and interactivity.  This does work (these widgets
    were first implemented in JS prior to Dart's existence and it worked fine there).
