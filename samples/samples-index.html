<h1>Dart / SVG dart-squid Samples Index</h1>

<div>
    <p>Note: these samples appear here only in their native DART version and will require the <a
            href="http://gsdview.appspot.com/dartium-archive/continuous/" target="_blank">Dartium browser for
       your platform.</a> Dartium browser is also included with the <a
            href="http://gsdview.appspot.com/dart-editor-archive-integration/latest/" target="_blank">Dart Editor</a>.
       Also, if you install the <a href="Dart Editor / SDK"></a>, the samples will run (via Dart2js) in:
       <ul>
        <li>Chromium browser &mdash; nearly identical behavior to Dartium (a few minor differences exist);</li>
        <li>Firefox browser &mdash; the widgets will be lacking borders, thus no way to move/size widgets; and, other issues persist;</li>
        <li>IE9 browser &mdash; almost the opposite of FireFox... borders show, move/size possible, but no text content shows in widgets;</li>
       </ul>

    </p>

<h3><a href="./sample-1/sample_1.html">Sample #1 (SVG wrapped in HTML)</a></h3>

<p>This is a very basic visual demonstration of the <strong>dart-squid Widgets</strong> in action.
    Play around a bit and you will notice some alignment features (between widgets and related to browser-window
    boundaries),
    some position-constraint features that invoke during movement,
    the ability to hide/show Widgets (including any hierarchically contained), multi-select, re-size/movement, and so
    forth.</p>

<p><b>NOTE: As of recent Dartium builds (based on Chrome v28.x+),
    <strong>visual painting / refresh (repaint regions) of those initially-showing SVG objects whose on-screen
    position is dependent on browser-window-metrics will not occur until you trigger a "resize" operation manually</strong>
    by either resizing the browser-window up toggling page-zoom-factor.</b>

    initial-SVG-Repaint-Region problem:</span>
<ul>
    <li><strong>DARTIUM as of latest build (Version 29.0.1530.0 (204370)) &mdash;
    simply open the Developer-Tools Window prior to refreshing page</strong> (Dev-Tools region can be sized as small as you choose)
    &mdsahs; so long as this is done, all Widgets will repaint / show on initial page display.
    </li>
    <li>Chromium / Browsers in general, <strong>prior to initial-widget-interaction, simply resize your
        browser window a bit or cycle the page-zoom (CTRL+, CTRL- keys)</strong> and the Widget(s) should all repaint and show.
    </li>
</ul>

<b>Note:</b>
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/dart/issues/detail?id=2977" target="_blank">Dart Issue 2977 &mdash; originally
    reported in May, 2012 &mdash;
    (ElementImplementation behavior fluctuates based on containing doc type (HTML vs. SVG)</a>
    is marked as "fixed", but implementation differences between HTML-"wrapped" SVG and standalone SVG persist.&nbsp;
    <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Standalone SVG document capabilities REMAIN broken and
    will terminate on error(s) in the Dart library internals.</span>.
    <b>These Widgets used to work just fine in standalone SVG documents</b>, before the Dart team
    apparently decided that SVG was a second-class document type and broke this capability.
&nbsp;
<br>
<br><b>The Dart team has since created a NEW issue with no timeline/milestone target for a fix</b>: see
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/dart/issues/detail?id=6947" target="_blank">Dart Issue 6947 &mdash; Support top-level
    SVG documents.</a>
Sadly, these continual problems in the Dart SVG implementations are making the goals of this project impossible to
implement.
<p>Another issue that existed in the non-HTML-wrapped-SVG version involved problematic event-handler removal, thus making the
    selection (and de-selection) of widgets unpredictable or impossible. This may be directly related to issue
    6947 (with regards to the element hierarchy in DART) since, by simply wrapping this SVG doc with a dummy-HTML file,
    the behavior within the embedded SVG is totally as expected and predictable. Clearly something is screwy in the Dart
    HTML library with regards to SVG elements that are "standalone" vs. "wrapped".</p>

<p><b> The ultimate goal is to remove the need for an outer HTML "wrapper" and have the entire "application" be just an
    SVG document with all embedded functionality and interactivity contained in
    that standalone SVG document. This does work (these widgets were first implemented in JS prior to Dart's existence
    and it worked fine there), though Dart's API/Library issues prevent this
    currently.</b>
