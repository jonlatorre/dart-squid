<h1>Dart / SVG dart-squid Samples Index</h1>

<div>
    <p>Note: these samples appear here only in their native DART version and will require the <a
            href="http://gsdview.appspot.com/dartium-archive/continuous/" target="_blank">Dartium browser for
        your platform.</a> Dartium browser is also included with the <a
            href="http://gsdview.appspot.com/dart-editor-archive-integration/latest/" target="_blank">Dart Editor</a>.

<h2>dart-squid Sample #1</h2>
<h3><a href="./sample-1/sample_1.html">Sample #1 (SVG wrapped in HTML)</a></h3>

<p>This is a very basic visual demonstration of the <strong>dart-squid Widgets</strong> in action.
    Play around a bit and you will notice some alignment features (between widgets and related to browser-window
    boundaries),
    some position-constraint features that invoke during movement,
    the ability to hide/show Widgets (including any hierarchically contained), multi-select, re-size/movement, and so
    forth.</p>

<p><b>NOTE: As of recent Dartium builds (based on Chrome v25.x+), the visual refresh of SVG objects (repaint regions)
    is rather messed up (**there are some "workarounds" I discuss (below) &mdash; like how the repaint issue is
    partially
    resolved simply by launching Dartium from the Dart Editor).</b>
</p>

<p>For some reason,
    the browser is no longer repainting SVG objects outside of an arbitrary rectangular area
    whose extent is currently defined as approximately having a width ending at the
    right-most "menu button" widget and a height that has no relation to anything.&nbsp;
    But, the browser WILL repaint SVG items anywhere on the screen IF you manually resize the browser window.&nbsp;
    It is bugs like this that prevent any substantial progress on this component set.&nbsp;
    If proper SVG repaints do not return to SVG rendering,
    this project is likely to be in a "holding pattern" and only implement minor Dart language / API updates while
    awaiting SVG fixes.
</p>

<p>
    In Feb-2013 widget build, I implemented a PARTIAL workaround by forcing widgets to undergo a complete Hide()/Show()
    (i.e., toggled their visibility on/off) while in a Move()/Size() operation to force repaints,
    but they will not all INITIALLY show until you slightly-resize the browser window first.
    And, nested SVG widgets do not yet repaint if in the region(s) affected by Webkit's
    refusal-to-repaint-bug!

    (Version 26.0.1403.0), there are some less-than-optimal "workaround" to the
    SVG-Repaint-Region problem available, including:</span>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Courtesy of the NEW developer-tools settings</strong> (Chrome v26+) &mdsahs; although RATHER SLOW
        (rendering) will
        ensue &mdash;
        change the dev tools "Rendering" setting such that <b>"Enable
            continuous page repainting"</b> is checked. This setting is located by clicking the "gear icon" in
        lower-right corner of developer tools window. IN ADDITION, this only works as long as the developer-tools
        (bottom window) remains "open", if even minimally in
        size
        (i.e., you can shrink its height to zero; just don't "close" it).
        <br>With this SLOW option enabled, Widgets will repaint anywhere on the screen like they used to
        in pre-Chrome-25.x versions of Chromium.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Use a Dartium-Launch to view the SVG Widget HTML pages, from within the Dart Editor.</strong>
        Whatever the Dart Editor is doing, it somehow forces the SVG Repaints to occur properly, but only for "top
        level" widgets,
        even without tweaking the developer-tools setting as mentioned above! So, this is a partial "workaround", but
        you
        still need to enable dev-tools-continuous-page-repainting to resolve <b>nested widgets repainting issues</b>.
    </li>
    <li>Launch in Dartium outside of the Editor, but prior to initial-widget-interaction, <strong>simply resize your
        browser window a bit</strong>
        and the Widget(s) should all show and then remain functional (but, nested widgets will remain problematic
        without continuous repaint).
    </li>
</ul>

<b>Note:</b>
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/dart/issues/detail?id=2977" target="_blank">Dart Issue 2977 &mdash; originally
    reported in May, 2012 &mdash;
    (ElementImplementation behavior fluctuates based on containing doc type (HTML vs. SVG)</a>
is marked as "fixed", but implementation differences between HTML-"wrapped" SVG and standalone SVG persist.&nbsp; <b>Standalone
    SVG version REMAINS broken</b> (hits an error stating: "<span
        style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Exception: NoSuchMethodError : method not found: '$dom_children'</span>").
&nbsp;
<br>
<br><b>The Dart team has since created a NEW issue with no timeline/milestone target for a fix</b>: see
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/dart/issues/detail?id=6947" target="_blank">Dart Issue 6947 &mdash; Support top-level
    SVG documents.</a>
Sadly, these continual problems in the Dart SVG implementations are making the goals of this project impossible to
implement.
<p>Another issue with the non-wrapped SVG version is odd behavior with event-code removal, thus making the
    selection (and de-selection) of widgets unpredictable or impossible. Again, this may be very much related to issue
    6947 (with regards to the element hierarchy in DART) since, by simply wrapping this SVG doc with a dummy-HTML file,
    the behavior within the embedded SVG is totally as expected and predictable. Clearly something is screwy in the Dart
    HTML library with regards to SVG elements that are "standalone" vs. "wrapped".</p>

<p><b> The ultimate goal is to remove the need for an outer HTML "wrapper" and have the entire "application" be just an
    SVG document with all embedded functionality and interactivity contained in
    that standalone SVG document. This does work (these widgets were first implemented in JS prior to Dart's existence
    and it worked fine there), though Dart's API/Library issues prevent this
    currently.</b>
